Escstream, Cooperative Wireless Embeded Circuits Video game.
Feb 2018 â€“ Jun 2019


Project in the scope of the course embedded circuit course from UCLouvain. 

Tasks: Per group of 4 the goal was to create from scratch a real time, synchronised cooperative puzzle game using a pair of DE10-Nano, MyPi-Nano and  Multi-Touch Screen.
In this context we used: Intel Quartus Prime, C , Assembly (Baremetal), MicroAbassi multi threaded, and TCP communication protocols

Action: The tasks were mainly done as a group, as it was required that we all could be able to explain the code. In particular I focused my effort on the implementation of the TCP protocols and communication tools (we communicated via FLAGS bits)  as well as the main game design rules.

Result: We implemented a fully fledge cooperative puzzle game that is playable in real-time by two players using touch screens but added option such as Level selections and Pause menu .
